# Code Organization Rules

## File Structure
- All source code should be in the `src` directory
- Components should be in `src/components`

- Types should be in `src/types`

## Naming Conventions
- Use PascalCase for component names (e.g., `PlayerComponent.tsx`)
- Use camelCase for functions and variables
- Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants

## Code Style
- Use TypeScript for all new files

- Keep components small and focused
- Use proper TypeScript types and interfaces
- Use always tailwind CSS

## Git Rules
- Write meaningful commit messages

## Performance Rules
- Lazy load components when possible
- Optimize images and assets
- Use proper memoization techniques

## Testing Rules
- Write unit tests for critical components
- Maintain good test coverage
- Use meaningful test descriptions

## Documentation
- Document complex functions and components
- Keep README up to date
